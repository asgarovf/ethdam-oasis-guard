# Sample Hardhat Project

This project demonstrates a basic Hardhat use case. It comes with a sample contract, a test for that contract, and a script that deploys that contract.

Try running some of the following tasks:

```shell
sapphire tesnet addresses
WebAuthn.sol: 0x21c12A8A12240417ECcFCe47645152EEbaaB8035
P256.sol: 0x5cAaA62aD13Ed1D8bD595E7aafeE2fC43735A7Bc
P256Verifier.sol: 0x70B46Dc19E7372e67c50E9076F2BE8291FDFB416
```

```shell
npx hardhat help
npx hardhat test
REPORT_GAS=true npx hardhat test
npx hardhat node
npx hardhat run scripts/deploy.ts
```
